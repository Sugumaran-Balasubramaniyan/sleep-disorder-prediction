## Project Overview

Sleep disorders, such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, are prevalent health issues that can significantly impact an individual's physical and mental well-being. This project, **Sleep Disorder Prediction**, aims to leverage data science techniques to analyze various lifestyle and medical variables, including age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, blood pressure, and more, to predict the likelihood and type of sleep disorder an individual may experience. By identifying individuals at risk, this project seeks to enable timely interventions and improve overall sleep health.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To analyze the relationships between lifestyle, medical variables, and sleep health.
2. To develop predictive models that can classify individuals into sleep disorder categories.
3. To provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals to design targeted interventions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset utilized in this project is the **"Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset"**, which comprises 400 records and 13 features. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of individuals' sleep patterns, lifestyle habits, and health metrics. Below is a detailed breakdown of the dataset's key components:

### Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Sleep Metrics**  
   The dataset includes detailed information on sleep duration, quality of sleep, and other factors influencing sleep patterns.

2. **Lifestyle Factors**  
   Insights into physical activity levels, stress levels, and BMI categories are provided, offering a holistic view of how lifestyle impacts sleep health.

3. **Cardiovascular Health**  
   Measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate are included, which are critical indicators of overall health and their potential correlation with sleep disorders.

4. **Sleep Disorder Classification**  
    The dataset categorizes individuals into three groups based on the presence or absence of sleep disorders:
   - **None**: No specific sleep disorder detected.
   - **Insomnia**: Difficulty in falling or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.
   - **Sleep Apnea**: Pauses in breathing during sleep, causing disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.
